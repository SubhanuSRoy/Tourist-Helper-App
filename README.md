# Tourist-Helper-App
The app helps a foreign tourist who is
visiting Kolkata by:
- Teaching them the first 10 natural
numbers and currency notes in Bengali.
- Teaching them the names given to
the family members in Bengali.
- Teaching them the colors in Bengali.
- Teaching them common phrases that
will help them converse in Bengali with
the local people.
- All the words have an audio file
attached with them to play the correct
Bengali pronunciation of the respective
word.
- The simple app has beautiful UI and
UX which was also made by me.
